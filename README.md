# morpheus-crowdin-plugin
The Morpheus UI Crowdin Plugin.


The Morpheus UI Crowdin Plugin enables translators to review and edit Morpheus translations stored within the Morpheus Crowdin project, directly within the Morpheus UI. Translations that are created/edited through the Plugin are saved back to the Crowdin platform and will be built into the next Morpheus UI release. With the Plugin enabled, users can navigate the Morpheus UI as usual and can quickly jump in and out of the Crowdin context
